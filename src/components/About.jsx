            <p>
              I work at the intersection of strategy and technology, helping leaders
              make informed decisions that shape the future. With a background spanning
              consulting, technology implementation, and innovation strategy, I bring
              a unique perspective to complex challenges.
            </p>
            <p>
              My approach is grounded in evidence and practicality. I believe innovation
              without execution is just imagination. That&apos;s why I focus on bridging
              the gap between strategic vision and tangible outcomes.
            </p>

              Whether it&apos;s AI adoption, digital transformation, or organizational
              change, the real question isn&apos;t whether to move forward&mdash;it&apos;s
              how to preserve strategic optionality while you do.
